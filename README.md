# trading-strategy-backend

Backend API for the Trading Strategy Platform.

## Live environments

| Environment | App | API | Branch |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Production** | https://trading.zemingzhang.com | https://api.zemingzhang.com | `main` |
| Staging | https://trading-stg.zemingzhang.com | https://api-stg.zemingzhang.com | `staging` |
| Dev | https://trading-dev.zemingzhang.com | https://api-dev.zemingzhang.com | `dev` |

Each long-lived branch auto-deploys its own environment on push. `feature/*`
branches are never deployed — test those locally with `docker compose up`.
